ABSTRACT. Ontology of arguments and intellectual contributions (like conjectures, definitions, and investigational methods) concerning philosophical issues (where philosophy is broadly construed to include large parts of mathematics, psychology, and much more).


#### View
Studying an author's intellectual contribution or formulating one's own proposal, it is useful to individuate the different elements that, together, aims at providing evidence for a given position or raising awareness of a problem. Arguments are perhaps the most prominent of these elements (hence the name of this ontology), but not the only ones. In this ontology I provides categories to classify these elements and I provide auxiliary categories to record relevant information concerning specific instances of intellectual contributions. 

I restrict consideration to those intellectual contributions that, in a fairly comprehensive sense, are philosophical. These means that I include arguments such as Anselm's so-called Ontological Argument and contributions of authors such as Plato and Descartes. However, I do not restrict philosophy to Western authors (or authors working within a, somewhat vaguely defined, Western intellectual tradition). Moreover, I do not restrict contributions to authors that we now primarily describe as philosophers or issues that are mainly studied in philosophy departments. So, for example, Georg Cantor's Diagonal Argument (which shows that there is no 1-1 correspondence between the set of rational numbers and the set of real numbers) fits this ontology (if pressed to say why, I would probably say because it is central piece in of a precise way to study the notion of infinity) as well as issues concerning empirical studies of mental representations (like those of Philip Johnson-Laird on mental models and Zenon Pylyshyn arguing against the existence of mental images).

#### State of the project
I stated the categories, both the principal ones (i.e. those concerning types of intellectual contributions) and the auxialiary ones (i.e. those concerning the who, when, how, and why a specific contribution was made).
