ABSTRACT. Ontology of arguments and other intellectual contributions (like conjectures, definitions, and investigational methods) concerning philosophical issues (where philosophy is broadly construed to include large parts of mathematics, psychology, and much more).


#### View
Studying an author's intellectual contribution or formulating one's own proposal, it is useful to individuate the different elements that, together, aims at providing evidence for a given position or raising awareness of a problem. Arguments are perhaps the most prominent of these elements (hence the name of this ontology), but not the only ones. In this ontology I provides categories to classify these elements and I provide auxiliary categories to record relevant information concerning specific instances of intellectual contributions. 

I restrict consideration to those intellectual contributions that, in a fairly comprehensive sense, are philosophical. These means that I include arguments such as Anselm's so-called Ontological Argument and contributions of authors such as Plato and Descartes. However, I do not restrict philosophy to Western authors (or authors working within a, somewhat vaguely defined, Western intellectual tradition). Moreover, I do not restrict contributions to authors that we now primarily describe as philosophers or issues that are mainly studied in philosophy departments. So, for example, Georg Cantor's Diagonal Argument (which shows that there is no bijection between the set of rational numbers and the set of real numbers) fits this ontology (if pressed to say why, I would probably say because this argument is a central piece of a precise way to study the notion of infinity) as well as issues concerning empirical studies of mental representations (like those of Philip Johnson-Laird on mental models and those of Zenon Pylyshyn against the existence of mental images).

#### Goal
To record specific contributions so that, by running appropriate queries combing main and auxiliary categories, one may obtain list of conrtibutions or else. For example, one may want to compare arguments of a given type (let's say all the diagonal arguments). This ontology allow (or will allow, when more complete) to obtain a list of such arguments (like Cantor's argument mentioned above and the argument showing that there is no computable list of all total computable functions). Alternatively, one may obtain a list of all the arguments defending a specific claim (e.g. that time has no beginning), concerning a given issue (like the epistemic reliability of intuition). One may also list contributions formulated by a specific author or during a specific time or in a certain geographic area (like all the arguments about God's omnipotency formulated at Oxford in the XV century). Moreover, perhaps intriguinly or just fancily, one may select contributions by the medium-type (like book, article, and report) or the object (like clay-tablet and scroll) on which a contribution was recorded or transmitted.

#### State of the project
I stated the categories, both the principal ones (i.e. those concerning types of intellectual contributions) and the auxialiary ones (i.e. those concerning the who, when, how, and why a specific contribution was made).

#### Description of the categories
There are two types of categories: main and auxiliary. The main categories are types of intellectual contributions. The auxiliary categories are types of information relevant to the study of the intellectual contributions. 

##### Main Categories
The are 14 main categories. 11 are types of contributions and 2 are types of types of contributions.

The 12 types of contributions are the following:
1. Argument (an ordered pair of a set of propositions, i.e. the premises, and a proposition, i.e. the conclusion)
2. Claim (a proposition asserted to be true)
3. Definition
4. Hypothesis (a proposition that one indicates as worth studying but whose truth-value she knowingly cannot determine)
5. Method (the organization of investigational resources and moves at one's disposal and deemed to be sufficiently reliable from an epistemic point of view)
6. Objection 
7. Problem (a proposition toward which one has an interrogative attitude)
8. Project (a planned or proposed undertaking, usually concerning the investigation of some issue and usually including a statement of the relevance of the possible outcomes and their connections to other inquiries)
9. Theory (a class of propositions closed under logical consequence) 
10. Quotation 
11. Sketch.

A few basic clarifications are in order. The word "hypothesis" is used in at least 3 different senses: (a) an assumption (especially a temporary one) to be tested or yet (mostly) unsupported, (b) a claim that, in principle, one can disprove, and (c) a proposition whose falsity cannot be established or legitimately assumed. In the first sense, one speak, for example, of the Continuum Hypothesis. In this sense, a hypothesis is sometimes also called a conjecture (whereas the word "conjecture" may indicate that the proponent of the conjecture expect it to be true). An example of the second meaning is the hypothesis that natural species evolve due to biological changes and environmental pressure. As an example of the third meaning, one can imagine raisining an objection to an argument by suggesting that a certain scenario has not been considered. In this ontology, I use the word "hypothesis" in none of these senses. Here, a hypothesis simply refers to a proposition that one expresses indicating as scientifically interesting but whose truth-value, under some assumptions, she is unable to decide at that time. There is no implication, or even implicature or expectation, that the author suspect or wishes the hypothesis to be true or that one can, even in principle, under some circumstances, determine its truth-value. For this reason, the ontology does not contain a category for doubts: I consider doubts as hypotheses of a kind.

The 3 types of types of contributions are the following:
1. Argument_type (the features common to arguments in a specific class, usually described as a schema of several arguments). In this sense, I speak of the Ontological Argument as a type of argument of which Anselm's, Descartes, and Plantinga's ones are specifications. It is sometimes useful to consider types of arguments because one can then study at a general level virtues and defects of several specific arguments
2. Definition_type (definitions can be explicit, like those at the beginning of Euclid's Elements book I, or implicit, like those in Hilbert's _Grundlagen der Geometrie_).
3. Objection_type (the features common to several specific objections to specific arguments).

Finally, I do not claim that either of these lists is correct or complete. I am open to deletion, addition, and revisions of any type. 

##### Auxiliary categories
There are 8 families of auxiliary categories:
1. Institution (the institute, school, circle, or the like whee the author worked or formulated her contribution)
2. Profession (in a broad sense, the occupation with which an author is mainly identified). So, for example, I say that both Plato and Kit Fine are philosophers.
3. Repository (the place, physical or virtual, where one can access a specific resource)
4. Space (the place where an author formulated her contribution)
5. Time (the time when an author formulated her contribution)
6. Subject (the area of investigation to which a contribution belongs). Subjects are, for example, mathematics, philosophy, and psychology.
7. Work_medium (the medium on which a contribution was recorded). Within work_media, I distinguish the physical connotations of a medium (like tablet and scroll) the type of a medium (like a dissertation, an article, and a note).
