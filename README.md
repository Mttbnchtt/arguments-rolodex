ABSTRACT. Ontology of arguments and other intellectual contributions (like conjectures, definitions, and investigational methods) concerning philosophical issues (where philosophy is broadly construed to include large parts of mathematics, psychology, and much more).


#### View
Studying an author's intellectual contribution or formulating one's own proposal, it is useful to individuate the different elements that, together, aims at providing evidence for a given position or raising awareness of a problem. Arguments are perhaps the most prominent of these elements (hence the name of this ontology), but not the only ones. In this ontology I provides categories to classify these elements and I provide auxiliary categories to record relevant information concerning specific instances of intellectual contributions. 

I restrict consideration to those intellectual contributions that, in a fairly comprehensive sense, are philosophical. These means that I include arguments such as Anselm's so-called Ontological Argument and contributions of authors such as Plato and Descartes. However, I do not restrict philosophy to Western authors (or authors working within a, somewhat vaguely defined, Western intellectual tradition). Moreover, I do not restrict contributions to authors that we now primarily describe as philosophers or issues that are mainly studied in philosophy departments. So, for example, Georg Cantor's Diagonal Argument (which shows that there is no bijection between the set of rational numbers and the set of real numbers) fits this ontology (if pressed to say why, I would probably say because this argument is a central piece of a precise way to study the notion of infinity) as well as issues concerning empirical studies of mental representations (like those of Philip Johnson-Laird on mental models and those of Zenon Pylyshyn against the existence of mental images).

#### Goal
To record specific contributions so that, by running appropriate queries combing main and auxiliary categories, one may obtain list of conrtibutions or else. For example, one may want to compare arguments of a given type (let's say all the diagonal arguments). This ontology allow (or will allow, when more complete) to obtain a list of such arguments (like Cantor's argument mentioned above and the argument showing that there is no computable list of all total computable functions). Alternatively, one may obtain a list of all the arguments defending a specific claim (e.g. that time has no beginning), concerning a given issue (like the epistemic reliability of intuition). One may also list contributions formulated by a specific author or during a specific time or in a certain geographic area (like all the arguments about God's omnipotency formulated at Oxford in the XV century). Moreover, perhaps intriguinly or just fancily, one may select contributions by the medium-type (like book, article, and report) and medium-material (like clay-tablet, and papyrus) on which a contribution was recorded or transmitted.

#### State of the project
I stated the categories, both the principal ones (i.e. those concerning types of intellectual contributions) and the auxialiary ones (i.e. those concerning the who, when, how, and why a specific contribution was made).
