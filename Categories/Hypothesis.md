#### Hypothesis

The word "hypothesis" is used in at least 3 different senses: (a) an assumption (especially a temporary one) to be tested or yet (mostly) unsupported, (b) a claim that, in principle, one can disprove, and (c) a proposition whose falsity cannot be established or legitimately assumed. In the first sense, one speak, for example, of the Continuum Hypothesis. In this sense, a hypothesis is sometimes also called a conjecture (whereas the word "conjecture" may indicate that the proponent of the conjecture expect it to be true). An example of the second meaning is the hypothesis that natural species evolve due to biological changes and environmental pressure. As an example of the third meaning, one can imagine raisining an objection to an argument by suggesting that a certain scenario has not been considered. In this ontology, I use the word "hypothesis" in none of these senses. Here, a hypothesis simply refers to a proposition whose truth-value the researcher is unable to decide. There is no implication, or even implicature or expectation, that the author suspect or wishes the hypothesis to be true or that one can, even in principle, under some circumstances, determine its truth-value. For this reason, the ontology does not contain a category for doubts: I consider doubts as hypotheses of a kind.
